# IISE-paper-code
The following is the code description document for IISE:

First, regarding the CNN-Bi-GRU-MHAM-BO code in file 1.Python-code.zip, it is required to be programmed in Python or Jupyter environments. Meanwhile, Python packages such as Kears, pandas, numpy, etc. need to be installed, and CMAPSSData is for the dataset, which can be downloaded from NASA's official website.

Second, regarding the WS-CPLEX and epsilon CPLEX code in file 2.C++-code.zip, it is required to be programmed in a C++ environment such as Visual Studio 2022. Meanwhile, CPLEX needs to be installed and embedded into C++ software, and VNSGA-II code can be run directly in the C++ environment. In addition, the IISE-shuju in the document provides data for validating the model and algorithm.
